# Labyrinth visualizer

This repository contains a simple JavaScript application that can be run in-browser to preview labyrinthine patterns generated by [seals-gen](https://github.com/k-j0/seals-gen).

## Running

- Run a local HTTP server (e.g. Apache)
- Access [index.html](index.html) on localhost (path depends on HTTP server config)
- If the setup is successful, a rotating cube will be shown
- Click the load (â­±) button (bottom left) to upload a file; accepted formats are JSON and binary files generated by [seals-gen](https://github.com/k-j0/seals-gen) (note: binary files are preferred, loading a JSON file may not allow access to all features in the visualizer)
